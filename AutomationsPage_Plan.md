# Plan for Automations Page

## Overview
Create a creative, well-structured **Automations** page that educates users about business automation in a clear, engaging, no-nonsense style. The design will match your website's modern, glassmorphic, animated aesthetic.

---

## 1. Create a new React component
- **File:** `src/AutomationsPage.tsx`
- **Export:** `AutomationsPage`
- **Styling:** Tailwind CSS, consistent with the rest of the site

---

## 2. Add routing
In `App.tsx`, add:
```tsx
<Route path="/automations" element={<AutomationsPage />} />
```
This will render the new page when clicking the Automations menu item.

---

## 3. Page Layout

### Hero Section
- **Headline:**  
  **"Learn What Business Automation Really Means"**
- **Intro paragraph:**  
  "Our education center is designed to give you practical information about business automation without the hype or technical jargon. We believe in empowering you to make informed decisions, whether or not you decide to work with us."
- **Design:**  
  Animated gradient text, subtle background hexagon grid, large and engaging.
